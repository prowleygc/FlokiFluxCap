Floki Studio Flux Capacitor 

Instructions: 

Note: This is very delicate and has exposed wires. Please be careful when unpackaging and do not use a blade to cut the boxes open! 

Once unpackaged, the unit can be mounted to one of the racks in the studio. Please contact Wade for placement instructions prior to mounting. 

Included in the box is a usb cable and power adapter. Please do not use any other power adapters for powering this display. The maximum voltage for power is 5v at .5 amps. The included apple power adapter is perfect for this application.

The power adapter should be plugged in to the rack power distribution so that when the racks are turned on, the lights will light up. The on/off toggle can turn off the lights if they are not desired. 

If for some reason the lights do not ‘pulse’ when turned on, turn the on/off switch to off for 30 seconds, then turn it back on. This should resolve that issue.
